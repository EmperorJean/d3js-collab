# D3.js Circle Animation Comparison

This was a fun extra credit assignment we did. Each person was to, using D3.js, come up with a way to generate 100 circles. We all had different ways, so we decided it'd be fun to see which one is better when it comes to performance, so I borrowed the functions from the collaborators and charted them up.
